# Unexpected Pointer Behavior in C

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often unexpected, issue when working with pointers in C. The provided code seems straightforward but leads to a result that can be confusing for beginners.

## The Bug

The `bug.c` file contains a simple program intending to print the value of a variable. However, due to the use of pointers, the output differs from what might be initially expected. This illustrates how pointer manipulation must be handled carefully to avoid unintended side effects.

## The Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.c`. It aims to clarify the issue and show how proper memory handling can resolve this type of pointer-related problem. This highlights that understanding memory addresses and pointer dereferencing is crucial in C programming.

Feel free to explore the code, run it, and see the unexpected result for yourself!
